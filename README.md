Overview
=============
Project based on using stochastic optimisation algorthims to break the keys on monoalphabetic sustitution ciphers. Written in Java, the program takes a block of text as an input and a randomly generated, 26 character key to encrypt it. The program contains three different stochastic optimisation algorthims to use for attack - genetic, hill climb, and partical swarm.
